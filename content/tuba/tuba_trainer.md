A few years ago I switched from BBb to EEb tuba, this meant a new set of fingerings to learn.

I made a simple javascript trainer for Bb, Eb, and C tubas. Oddly I couldn't find one online :) 

Click [here](https://slackspace.io/tuba/) for the trainer. 

The controls are very simple. 

* Left arrow = 1st valve
* Middle arrow = 2nd valve
* Right arrow = 3rd valve
* Up arrow = 'open' 

Press the correct combination then release. The page will show if you were correct. 

Hit Space to have a new note.
