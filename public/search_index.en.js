It skews the averages. What is my cadence/pace on only &gt;20km bike rides?\nIt would be fun to do.\n\nUnfortunately Garmin charges(!) to use their API. Disappointing. The simplest method for data I found was to manually export(20 events at a time..) from garmin connect. This gave me a bunch of .csv files to work with.\nInitially I tried to just use a file input on logstash with the csv filter. Unfortunately Garmin is not consistent with it's data formats in events. The biggest issue were pace/speed fields varying. \"1:50 min/100 m\" - swimming,  \"15.6\" (kph) - cycling/rowing/some swimming,  or \"4:30\" (4:30/min km) - running/walking.\nI ended up writing a python parser to do the following:\n\nRead conf file indicating format of csv/important fields for each activity type in the csv\nConvert fields into usable formats for Kibana graphing\nGenerate json logging/send to Logstash 'ready to go' for ES/Kibana.\n\nThe current version of the parser is here .

It's called 'Alert', i've submitted a pull request on github for it here. It is a work in progress, but the basic functionality I wanted appears to work. The initial requirements were:\n\nGenerate a single alert when something goes wrong. Don't spam.\nBe able to alert on both volume of a particular message or lack thereof\nIf alerting on lack thereof, alert even if there was 0 messages during the period\n\nI started with the throttle filter but felt the use case I wanted to use was a bit different than that filter was intended to do. I used it's code as a base for this filter. Disclaimer: This is my first attempt at Ruby, so I am sure it is quite rough code wise. :D\nFor all the examples below we will use the typical httpd access logs we all know and love.\n\n\nGenerate an alert if there are more than 10 404s in a 5 minute period. We will use the [response] field created by %{COMBINEDAPACHELOG} and generate an alert for each message we see with an response code '404'. This is done using the max_threshold option.\n\n  \n\nThe above uses the key \"404Alert\" to track these events within the filter. For each trigger of this filter the count will be incremented. If 11 or more occurences are counted within 300 seconds a single event is created for the entire 300 second period.\n\nGenerate an alert if you do not see atleast 10 '202's in a 5 minute period. Using the same [response] field as above. You have two options when using the min_threshold option. Both options require the below config -- The actual event you are wanting to track:\n\n \n\nThis configuration will generate an alert if there is less than 10 events in a 5 minute period. However, the event can only be created when the alert filter is triggered. This means if you have 3 events in the first 5 minutes, then another 90 minutes later you will receive the alert at the 95 minute mark.\nTo get around this limitation there is a 'heartbeat' flag one can use. This is the second option to min_threshold. Add the alert in either the root of filter(triggers on every event) or in another filter that has a high enough volume of events to ensure it will trigger. It would look like this:\n\nFor now you have to mirror your configuration in both alert filters, especially the key as that is how the filter tracks your events. The heartbeat flag causes the filter to only check two things:\n\nDoes an entry for this key exist? If not, make one and exit\nIf the key does exist, has my time expired? If so, evaluate the min_threshold. Alert if needed, delete key, exit.\n\nThe goal is to let you monitor the presence of certain logs to confirm stuff and things are working. If all the things die you still want to receive an alert!\nOnce you've created your filters, you can then leverage the results in output{} . When a threshold alert is triggered a new event is created. The message and tag is configurable, by default the tag is 'alert_filter'.  Here is how you could send an email for the 404 alert above.\n\nPossible Options in logstash.conf:\n\nSome future enhancements i'd like to do:\n\nNot require duplication of configuration when leveraging heartbeat.\nConfigure alarms only during certain times.\nImprove performance, code is rough.\nMake various tags created optional/configurable.\n\nHopefully someone else finds a use for this filter.

The github issue is here . This bug causes the new event to hit every filter below it in the config, regardless of the conditionals. This can result in additional tags being added, or other filters being applied to the event if they match. Not to mention a performance hit.\nFortuantely there is a work around, albeit crude/cumbersome. The deprecated 'tags =&gt; ' and 'type =&gt;' conditionals within a filter statement still work. My current method of minimizing impact from this bug is a three step process.\n\nWrite the conditional i'd normally use for the merge filter, but instead mutate and add a unique tag to that event. This can be done anywhere in the config.\nAt the very bottom of my filter configuration list the merges out, using the 'tags =&gt;' option with the unique tag added above\nUse Mutate at after the merges to remove these tags so they do not end up in ElasticSearch.\n\nIn my setup I also group all my merges in a single conditional at the bottom of the config to limit the number of events that then are compared against the 'tags =&gt;' conditional. If you have any filters/conditionals without a 'tags =&gt;' option after your merges the event will be ran through it.

For now, if you have add_tag on the merge filter the tag will be added to both the original trigger event, and the new event. merge_tag will only be added on the new merged event.\nEvaluate time on incoming events before overriding existing value. Right now, if your events come out of order the last one seen by logstash will be stored.\n\nI've used this for a variety of use cases so far.

You simply can identify issues/patterns/stuff that you'd never otherwise see. I've started working with logstash at my new company, it's been a great experience. I am notorious for skimming docs, and experimenting to figure things out..So Here are some various things i've learned/bashed my head against on the way. I am sure many, if not all, are explained in the docs :)\nUsefool tools:\n\nGrok Debugger -- Simply amazing. Once you get the hang of logstash/filters, it makes building new filters a breeze.\n#logstash @ freenode - Friendly and helpful\nLogstash.net and elasticsearch.org have top notch documentation.\n\nLogstash leverages grok which has many prebuilt patterns that make standardized logs a breeze to import. I have a great deal of custom logs, which left me with building(and still much left) customized grok patterns. A few tips:\nStart off with the raw logs going into logstash. Find the field you'd like to build a pattern for to better tag/break down. i.e. 'message' field. Take that field to the grok debugger and build your pattern. Once you have your pattern build your config.\n\nPretty simple config, things I bashed my head against:\n\nBuilding a grok for the entire log entry as it came from syslog. The match line is only matching against the 'message', not the entire line. Logstash is smart enough to get the timestamp, logsource, program name, etc and leaves the rest of it was 'message'.\nAll entries were receiving '_grokparsefailure' tag, even when they also got the tags I set. I believe this is due to me attempting to match lines on filters that fail(hence the tag). The end goal is to only apply a filter to a line I expect to match, but until then using 'tag_on_failure = []' will prevent this duplicate tag from being created.\n'type' can be anything you want. 'syslog' is an input plugin, and 'message' is a field of data -- and in this case created automatically by using the syslog input plugin.\nMany tutorials use type =&gt; 'syslog' in the grok statement. This is deprecated, the above is the current method.\nIf you want to graph on a number you tag in a log, you need to include the :int after the semantic name like above. Otherwise you will get a class exceptio when building the graph.\n\nHandy commands to use with ElasticSearch:\n\nI initially set logstash up, configured the syslog plugin and pumped everything into it -- a few months ago. The result? A ton of logs, but not very usable. I could search over a large set but I couldn't graph response time, error codes, or anything of real use. It was a very good method of consuming large amounts of disk space though:). The above command lets you delete indexes. Either rotate older indexes or wipe out everything. Be careful though, kibana-int holds your dashboards and you can just as easily delete it ;).  I wrote another page on using snapshots to backup data in general, or specific indexes such as kibana-int here .\nQueries in Kibana:\n\nLucene query article from ElasticSearch\nYou can do things like exists:$tag, or tag:(query1 query2). This lets you create graphs that may cross multiple tags, but still limit data how you want.  This also goes back to how you build the dataset, which is something I am still going back and forth on.\nAND, OR, NOT are how you string queries together. All of this is in the above link, but I know myself and other colleagues felt a bit unimpressed by kibana's search initially until we learned the Lucene query language. Much better now.\n\nThings I am still wrestling with:\n\nHow to layout logstash.conf. With the amount of custom logs I am parsing it can get messy in a hurry.\nBest use of tags/fields. By role, vendor, both? Many queries may cross roles/vendors but I'd still want to filter down when I can to improve performance.\nHow to deal with logs I am not tagging. Store to a different index I rotate more frequent and store tagged logs only in another? Discard them instantly?\nWhether to use logstash-forwarder or not, currently not\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/operations/logstash-learnings/","title":"Learnings from Logstash"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/operations/logstash-rabbitmq-tuning/":{"body":"My current setup is a pretty common Logstash stack. It consist of various inputs coming into a non filtering Logstash which dumps these messages into RabbitMQ. From RabbitMQ I can have multiple Logstash indexers slurp from RabbitMQ, apply filtering, and output to Elasticsearch, on to further processing, etc.\nThe only articles I found when attempting this referenced the AMPQ input/output plugins, which is not how one integrates with RabbitMQ these days. As well, there wasn't much information around tuning. Here is my current configuration along with some comments of various settings I tried/results I experienced.\nThe flow:\nLog/Data inputs -&gt; LS(No filters) -&gt; RabbitMQ -&gt; LS Indexers(filtering) -&gt; Elasticsearch/Other.\nRabbitMQ output configuration:\n\nRabbitMQ input configuration:\n\nKey values:\n\nexchange - Match on output and input plugin\nkey - Match on output and input plugin\nqueue - Must be set on input plugin, it should also match on all indexers.  Otherwise, a 'random' queue is created each time LS connects.\ndurable - Set to true so queue persist through a crash or restart of RabbitMQ.\npersistent - Set to true so messages are written to disk and persist through RabbitMQ restarting.\n\nInitially I had a hard time achieving more than 1500msg/sec on the indexer side. This would result in the queue to fill up indicating my Logstash indexers had fallen behind.\nRabbitMQ Tuning\nAt first it would appear the bottleneck is on the RabbitMQ server. Checking iotop one would find allot of disk I/O. RabbitMQ has some great writeups about why and when it writes to disk here. In short, since message acknowledgement is enabled every message is written to disk. This does not mean every message is read from disk, which you can observe from iotop. Lots of writing, no reading. RabbitMQ will eventually start reading from disk if the queue gets large enough and RabbitMQ consumes enough of system memory. I added the following configuration to discourage RabbitMQ from this behaviour:\n\nThis is the only configuration I've done thus far with RabbitMQ, and after the Logstash tuning below it may not even be needed. RabbitMQ is fast, and I don't expect it to be my bottleneck anytime soon.\nLogstash Tuning\nThe setting no_ack =&gt; true greatly improved the throughput, or so it appeared at first.  By default Logstash sends an acknowledgement after each message is processed. Turning off this setting means RabbitMQ will not wait for the 'ack' and continue sending messages to Logstash. This resulted in the queue being empty even under the highest load, and what appeared to be better throughput. Seeing 7-9k/sec events yet nothing in the Queue. Unfortunately this was just an illusion.\nLogstash uses a 'SizedQueue' hardcoded to 20 to throttle messages from input -&gt; filter. The intent is if filters are busy this will block inputs, which in theory would stop receiving new events until there is free resources.\nThis works with no_ack=&gt;false because RabbitMQ plugin sends an ack after it puts the event in the SizedQueue. If the SizedQueue is full it blocks until there is space, which blocks the ack. This in turns prevents more events coming from RabbitMQ, and thus the Queue on RabbitMQ begins filling up.\nWith no_ack=&gt;true RabbitMQ ignores the prefetch count and sends all of the events in the queue straight into LogStash.  Once the SizedQueue is fulll the events continue to pile up behind the ones waiting for resources. Memory consumption grows and eventually OOM Exceptions are thrown. On top of this, you lose every message that had been sent from RabbitMQ -&gt; Logstash since no_ack=&gt;true means RabbitMQ forgets about the message the moment it sends it. You also lose messages every time you restart an indexer with this configuration.\nSending the ack very well may be a performance decrease, though I don't know how much of one,  but it certainly is not worth the risk of losing messages.\nThe way I've been able to increase throughput is by increasing the number of filter workers Logstash uses. According to this Jira issue setting worker threads in sysconfig do not work, so one must use '--filterworkers'. You can set this in LS_OPTS value, or however you wish to pass it at startup. This allows faster processing of events from input-&gt;filter thus preventing RabbitMQ from blocking when waiting for a spot in the queue. Unfortunately this limits you to using on filters that are threadsafe.\nWith these settings we've reached 6-9k/sec per indexer at peak with no hesitation. This performance is greatly dependent on your filters, which we have a considerable amount of.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/operations/logstash-rabbitmq-tuning/","title":"RabbitMQ and Logstash"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/operations/ns2-dedicated-server-linux/":{"body":"Natural Selection 2 released both client and server version for Linux\nthis week.

I personally carry a USB bottle\nopener my sister gave me which has a bootable linux distro on one\npartition, and storage on the other. At any time I can open a beer, and\nboot linux!In that order ofcourse. :)\nDoge: D8kWKgF2x6gsiZzRyXgonogPQuRMxf6qtp\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/operations/one-usb-drive-two-partitions-much-useful/","title":"One USB Drive, Two Partitions.

A couple former colleagues used Pelican and I've always wanted to try it. Also took this chance to configure varnish infront of all my sites. I've been over deployments of varnish, but this is my first time deploying it for personal use. I used my friend Scott's writeup on varnish as a base. There are a few differences on Fedora though, such as systemd being configured different than /etc/default method.\nLet's go..\nInstall varnish, included in Fedora's Main repos\n\nInstead of configuring varnish in /etc/default/varnish in systemd/Fedora these configuration values are found in /etc/varnish/varnish.params and are referenced by /usr/lib/systemd/system/varnish.service .\nThe jist of the setup is varnish starts listening on 80, instead of apache, then it request locally to apache on 8080, if not cached, and then returns the needful back to the client. To accomplish this I needed to change apache to listen on a different port, 8080, and for varnish to listen on 80.\nValues changed in /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf\n\nI also needed to change /etc/varnish/varnish.params.\n\nThe default port was 6081 which. Not changing this setting but changing apache would result in your site being down hard :)\nAs Scott and others point out to get your IP's correct in httpd logging you need to add make varnish forward it and apache to change it's log format.\nI changed this section of /etc/varnish/default.vcl\n\nInitially it tried to set X-Forwarded-For which seemed to fail. I stole Scott's version of the config and it worked like a charm.\nFor apache, I modified /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf to use a new log format. Instead of changing each virtual host, I just changed the default line outside of the virtual host. If I later want to split my site's logs off I will, but for now access.log works.\n\nRestart varnish and apache and test your site. We can see varnish is working:\n\nNotice the \"hit deliver\", compared to:\n\nvarnishlog and varnishstat are both quite handy for confirming/triaging your varnish setup.\nOverall a pretty smooth migration to Pelican with a varnish setup. I still have some cleanup of the imported post, such as tags and links.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/operations/varnish/","title":"Varnish and Pelican Migration"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/operations/wireshark-fun/":{"body":"Quick and dirty way to configure a wireless router(Airport Express), to\nuse your linux pc as a network gateway.
